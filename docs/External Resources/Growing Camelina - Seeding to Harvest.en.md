## Summary
### An In-Depth Guide to Camelina Production in 2023

Camelina, an underestimated oilseed crop, has gained significant attention in recent years as a promising feedstock for renewable diesel. In this article, we will delve into the detailed process of cultivating camelina, the benefits of this crop, experiences from the field, and insights from the company leading the charge, Sustainable Oils. Whether you are a farmer considering camelina, an investor in renewable energy, or simply curious about modern agricultural practices, this article will arm you with everything you need to know about camelina production in 2023.

#### Understanding Camelina and Its Benefits

##### What is Camelina?

Camelina, also known as gold-of-pleasure or false flax, is an oilseed crop that has been cultivated for centuries. Recently, it has been recognized for its potential in producing renewable diesel. Camelina oil features an ultra-low carbon intensity score, making it a favorable option over other oilseeds such as canola and soy. This low carbon footprint is crucial in today’s push towards sustainable fuels.

##### Renewable Diesel Feedstock

Renewable diesel, derived from camelina oil, is nearly a drop-in replacement for traditional petroleum-based fuels but with significantly fewer contaminants and emissions. The low carbon intensity of camelina makes it particularly attractive as the world seeks to reduce its carbon footprint.

##### Drought Tolerance and Revenue Potential

One of camelina's standout features is its impressive drought tolerance. This characteristic was notably observed in Montana during the drought of 2021, when camelina outperformed other crops with a yield potential of up to 2,000 pounds per acre. Farmers also benefit from camelina’s ability to replace fallow or idle acres in crop rotations, thereby providing an additional revenue source. The oil content in each harvest makes up about 38-42% of the total yield, with the remaining biomass usable as livestock feed.

#### Sustainable Oils: The Catalyst for Camelina Cultivation

##### Company Overview

Sustainable Oils, based in Great Falls, Montana, is at the forefront of camelina research and production. Owned by Global Clean Energy Holdings, the company oversees grower contracts, research, and development. They foster strong relationships with local farmers, ensuring that both the cultivation and commercialization processes are well-managed.

##### Strategic Partnerships

Sustainable Oils' parent company also owns a refinery located in California and has secured a multi-year agreement with Exxon Mobil, ensuring a stable and robust market for camelina-based renewable diesel. This strategic alliance underscores the economic and environmental viability of camelina as a renewable resource.

#### The Camelina Growing Process

##### Contracting and Payment

The first step in the camelina growing process is the contract agreement between farmers and Sustainable Oils. Typically, the contracting takes place in early spring before planting. For the 2023 season, farmers could earn $350 per acre for cultivating 160 acres of camelina. Sustainable Oils provides the seeds free of charge, while farmers cover other inputs like machinery and fertilizers. Farmers store the harvested camelina in their grain bins, with the assurance of delivery within a year.

##### Planting

Planting camelina involves precise techniques to maximize yield and minimize weed pressure. Farmers often use equipment like the Pottinger disc drill for ultra-narrow row spacing. The seed placement is critical, and Sustainable Oils provides hands-on support to ensure correct depth settings.

"We seated in ultra-narrow row spacing on this crop in order to try to maximize production per acre and minimize any pressures for weeds by really packing the seed population in with camelina," Riley explains.

In terms of soil preparation, farmers typically use vertical tillage tools to incorporate fertilizer into the soil before planting. Kyle, a Sustainable Oils expert, assists farmers in setting the required seed depth, a crucial factor particularly with tiny seeds like camelina.

##### Fertilization

Fertilizer application plays a vital role in the health and yield of camelina. Early signs of nitrogen deficiency in the crop can impact its development. A balanced application of around 20 pounds of nitrogen at the time of seeding is typical, although subsequent applications may be necessary based on crop conditions.

##### Harvest

Harvesiting camelina poses unique challenges. The crop is similar to canola but has thicker, rounder pods, making threshing and separation more complex. Harvest timing is crucial to minimize shattering, where ripe pods break open and seeds fall out. Farmers need to balance fan speeds and sieve settings to separate pods without blowing out the small seeds.

"You cannot tell how good your sample is in this crop by just looking at it because all of these pods are going to settle to the top," explains Riley. The goal is to run a high amount of tailings to keep recirculating the crop for a cleaner yield.

Combines move more slowly through camelina fields compared to other crops, and minimizing crop loss is a priority. Sustainable Oils is aware of these challenges and is continuously working on improvements such as aftermarket sieves to enhance harvest efficiency.

#### Working with Sustainable Oils

##### On-the-Ground Support

One of the most notable aspects of working with Sustainable Oils is their commitment to providing on-the-ground support. Their team spends considerable time ensuring that farmers have the guidance and tools they need, from seed placement to harvest techniques. This collaborative approach makes the cultivation process smoother and more efficient.

##### Practical Experience and Feedback

Farmers appreciate the practical experience and feedback provided by Sustainable Oils. Their intimate understanding of the challenges faced by producers in Montana and other regions allows for better problem-solving and more robust crop performance.

#### Conclusion

In summary, camelina represents a highly promising solution for renewable diesel production, offering environmental benefits, additional revenue for farmers, and practical advantages in crop rotation scenarios. The meticulous approach to growing this crop, backed by comprehensive support from Sustainable Oils, ensures that farmers can achieve optimal results.

From seed to harvest, camelina cultivation requires understanding, precision, and collaboration. As the push for sustainable energy continues, camelina will likely play an increasingly significant role, driven by the innovation and dedication of companies like Sustainable Oils. For farmers, investors, and the curious alike, camelina is a crop worth paying attention to in the evolving landscape of renewable energy.
