# Why Grow Camelina?
Camelina is an advantageous crop choice for farmers seeking profitable, sustainable, and resilient agricultural options, especially in dryland and challenging climates. It offers high demand as a feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, requires no new equipment investments, and can enhance soil health within crop rotations.

## High Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

- **Emerging Feedstock of Choice:** Camelina has become the preferred oilseed crop for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production due to its high oil content and ultra-low carbon intensity compared to alternative crops.
- **Growing Market Opportunity:** With increasing demand anticipated in the coming years, there's a need for expanded camelina cultivation, presenting a lucrative opportunity for innovative growers.

## Agronomic Advantages

- **Resilient Crop:** Originating from Eastern Europe and belonging to the mustard family, camelina is similar to canola but with superior drought and spring freezing tolerance, allowing it to thrive in less-than-ideal climates.
- **Short Growing Season:** Camelina matures in 85-110 days, making it suitable for various planting schedules and regions.
- **Efficient Use of Soil Moisture:** Its root system is efficient in dryland conditions, yielding an average of 1.5 tonnes per hectare, and can exceed 2 tonnes per hectare with higher rainfall and proper management.

## Flexibility in Crop Rotations

- **Double-Cropping Potential:** Camelina can serve as the first crop in double-crop rotations, enabling farmers to harvest two crops in a single season from the same land.
- **Winter and Spring Varieties:** Options for both winter and spring planting allow for flexibility, with planting windows from mid-October through February, depending on the region.

## No Additional Equipment Investments

- **Use Existing Machinery:** Farmers can cultivate camelina using their current planting equipment and combines, eliminating the need for new machinery purchases.
- **Conservation Program Participation:** Camelina can participate in conservation crop rotation programs focused on soil protection and health improvement.

## Soil Health and Nutrient Management

- **Nutrient Recycling:** Camelina helps conserve soil nutrients remaining from previous crops and recycles them for subsequent crops, promoting sustainable farming practices.

## Support and Profitability

- **Market Opportunities:** Growers can secure contracts at fixed prices per pound, ensuring a guaranteed market and stable income.
- **Agronomic Support:** Partnerships may include provided planting seeds and close collaboration from pre-planting through harvest to maximize yield and profitability.
