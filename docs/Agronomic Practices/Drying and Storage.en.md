# Drying & Storage

Ensure harvested camelina seeds have less than 9% moisture content to avoid spoilage during storage. Clean and dry seeds promptly after harvest.

- **Moisture**: For safe long-term storage, seed moisture content should be below 9%. If necessary, dry seeds immediately after harvest.
- **Storage**: Store camelina in a well-ventilated, dry environment to prevent mold or spoilage. Seed cleaning should be done as soon as possible to reduce moisture levels and remove impurities.
