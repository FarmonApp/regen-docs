# Pests and Disease Control

Camelina is highly resistant to pests and diseases. However, late-stage mildew can occur, though it typically doesn’t affect yields.

- **Pests**: Camelina is rarely attacked by common pests in cover crop systems, such as flea beetles or seed weevils.

- **Diseases**: Fungicide applications are usually unnecessary. If downey mildew occurs late in the season, it typically has little impact on yield. Fungicides like azoxystrobin may be used if mildew appears before the rosette stage. There are other diseases that can effect Camelina such as aster yellows, club root and white rust, so be aware if these are common diseases in your region.
